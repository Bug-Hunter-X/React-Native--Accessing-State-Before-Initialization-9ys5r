## React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable or prop before it has been properly initialized. This can lead to unexpected behavior, rendering issues, or even crashes.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, illustrating how accessing `this.state.data` before it's populated results in an error.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected code, using the `useEffect` hook with a conditional rendering to address this issue.

**Key Concepts Illustrated:**

* Asynchronous State Updates
* useEffect Hook
* Conditional Rendering
* Error Handling in React Native

This example provides a clear and concise illustration of a frequent development challenge in React Native.
